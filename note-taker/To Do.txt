To Do List:
- Look/Feel
	- Make form resizable, components scale appropriately
	- Allow font to be customizable?
	- Rich Text Editor?
	- Add label beneath note showing creation date, last modified date, which updates when saved?

- So all exceptions are being shown when serializing/deserializing the note list...the only one 
  I've seen so far is when the note file hasn't been created yet, it gives an exception there.
  Clean this up.
	
- I don't wait the first note in the list to become selected again every time a new note is created!

- Also, decide which list will be used during which interactions. (new note, delete note, update note, etc.)
  - I'm thinking that there will be a "selectedNote" reference that is used for all interaction.

- Test the second note list to make sure that it only has references, not copies. If I change the note referenced
  in the displayNotes list, it should change the note in the allNotes list as well.
  - SUCCESS!
