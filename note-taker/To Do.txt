To Do List:
- Look/Feel
	- Make form resizable, components scale appropriately
	- Allow font to be customizable?
	- Rich Text Editor?
	- Add label beneath note showing creation date, last modified date, which updates when saved?

- Test the second note list to make sure that it only has references, not copies. If I change the note referenced
  in the displayNotes list, it should change the note in the allNotes list as well.
- Also, decide which list will be used during which interactions. (new note, delete note, update note, etc.)
